    "\n",
    "#### This codebase implements a [**Distributed Distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (D4PG)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08617.pdf) agent based upon the groundbreaking work by Google DeepMind.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "D4PG is itself an evolution out of the paper [_\"Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG)\"_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf), also groundbreaking, also by Google DeepMind.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DDPG is an architecture which allows for an **Actor** network to estimate a deterministic action policy while determining the _value_ of that action using a **Critic** network that outputs a Q-value by using the Action as part of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper introducing D4PG introduces several key improvements over the algorithm described in the original DDPG paper:\n",
    "* K-Actor distributed training\n",
    "* Prioritized Replay buffer\n",
    "* N-Step Rollout/Bootstrapping\n",
    "* **Distributional Value Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, the most important addition here is the _Distributional_ step. The other steps have been studied and/or implemented in other papers or textbooks, and feel more evolutionary to the DDPG algorithm than a truly new algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Distributional Value Estimation**_ allows the agent to not just estimate the value of a given action, but to estimate the probability of a value, thus allowing for uncertainty in the return. I certainly feel, and agree with the research that posits the idea, that allowing an agent to say \"This is X% likely to result in this value, but also Y% in this other value\" is much more like how a human, or intelligent creature, learns. At the very least it adds robustness to training by allowing for further complexity in comparing online and offline network estimations and thus improves loss calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This portion of the research is credited to:  \n",
    "[_\"A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning\"_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06887.pdf)  \n",
    "And should be considered a must-read for anyone interested in the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Categorial Projection**_ is key to the implementation of the distributional portion of this algorithm and ensures that the discretization of the target and local rewards correlate in a mathematically correct manner. The math here requires further study, but the papers above and certain repositories credited in the code were helpful in implementing the methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The D4PG paper suggested that **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)** did not result in demonstrable improvements in training, and thus, it was not implemented here. The results achieved by this agent do not seem to suffer for it's lack, but it would be good to test with and without to be thorough in evaluating training performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent does use **N-Step Bootstrapping** as described in the paper. N-Step bootstrapping performs Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning across N steps instead of a single SARS' tuple. In a plentiful-reward environment such as _Reacher_, removing uncertainty from value estimation is a huge win, and while I did not run trials of differing values for `N`, it is likely that larger values would have some positive effect, similarly to a PPO agent.\n"

    "None of these agents had early-termination procedures, so the 100-episode average is simply the final 100 episodes, not the point at which they technically solve the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while the agent can technically _solve_ the environment rapidly, there **is** benefit to running extra episodes to achieve greater stability. The weights included with this repository are associated with the first graph, which was trained for 500 episodes, or approximately 350+ additional episodes after _solving_ the environment. It performs more reliably in evaluation mode than some other saved weights that, while technically achieving the target score, sometimes display erratic behavior that didn't have a chance to be swatted out with additional training."

    "### Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The D4PG algorithm is robust to a very wide variety of hyperparameters, below are a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of the above examples, the learning rate varied considerably, and the `vmax` parameter was also robust to change. Many tests were run of differing `C` rates, Learning Rates, Pretrain amounts, and values for ATOMS/VMIN/VMAX, and while there was variation in speed and stability, the agent consistently solved the environment in less than 225 episodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`ACTOR_LEARN_RATE / CRITIC_LEARN_RATE`** - Tests were run, with good results, of values of 0.01-0.00005 for both values, generally ending with very robust results regardless. The sweet spot is around 0.0005 for the **actor**, and 0.001 for the **critic**. The Actor network should _always_ learn at a slower rate than the Critic, for stability. It would be a good goal for future work to test this out in a rigorous way, but all networks created for this class have thus far performed best when Actor is 50-75% of the Critic learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`C/TAU`** - I have consistently, across all projects, found that a HARD update type utilizing a parameter C controlling how many timesteps between updates, gives me superior performance over soft-update style gradual target network updating using parameter TAU. In the training for this agent, C is consistently set around 350. Tests were run with significantly higher values, thereby updating the network considerably less often, however, they performed poorly or not at all. It is my belief that because this environment collects 20 experiences per timestep, that hard updating the network more frequently is successful, due to the huge amount of experience rapidly collected about the current policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`EPSILON`** - Very interestingly, this agent was solved and perfected _without_ annealing Epsilon at all! This agent is robust enough that it can achieve very high scores even while having gaussian noise added to it's action output. Upon removing the noise for evaluation, the agent generally moves human-smoothly and perfects the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`PRETRAIN`** - The _Reacher_ environment achieved much better performance with at least several thousand pretraining steps performed before learning. Filling the buffer can be extremely fast, as there is no need to run either the Actor network, or any backpropogation. Random actions suffice to provide learnable experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`ROLLOUT`** - As stated above, n-step rollout was allowed to run in this environment, but was inconsequential to the results. This parameter could be set to 1 and achieve the same scores. Theoretically, having a rollout contribution should stabilize learning, but there was not computing bandwidth to run trials of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`L2_DECAY`** - Adding a very small Adam Optimizer l2 decay seemed to be a benefit, this parameter was never tuned in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`ATOMS`** - Atoms/Num_Atoms controls the granularity with which the probability distribution is estimated from the Q-network. More Atoms equals a finer-grained discretization of the curve. Note that _**more atoms does not equal better performance**_. The D4PG paper suggested that 51 atoms was a sweet spot for their tasks, while I found 75-101 atoms to be more efficacious in this task, for whatever reason. More than 101 atoms negatively affected performance. There is likely further research to be done, or read up upon if someone has already performed it, on the relationship between action complexity, reward density, and the number of `atoms` which is effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`VMIN / VMAX`** - _vmin_ and _vmax_ are the bounds on the values predicted by the Agent. The `atoms` are distributed between these two values, which are in turn multiplied by the probabilities from the Critic network to arrive at the value distribution. Because there are no negative rewards in this environment, the value for `vmin` must necessarily be set to 0, the lowest value of any state/action. The value for `vmax` is  more ephemeral... the maximum value for a timestep is 0.1, however, the value function estimates _total return_, and due to the categorical projection step, the current _real rewards_ are added to the value distribution estimation, and bounded by `vmax` as well. Thus, an argument could be made that `vmax` should be set to the theoretical maximum episode score (perhaps 40) for the environment. However, experimentally, the agent performed best when `vmax` was set between 0.3 and 0.5. **0.5** is the same value as the number of rollout steps implemented multiplied by the per-step reward maximum... it is possible there is a relationship between the n-step bootstrapping and the ideal value for the `vmax` parameter. This would need to be further researched in a more rigorous way in additional settings.\n"

    "### Future Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Categorical Projection** is the step by which the target values are projected onto the supports defined by the local value function. The math and concepts here stretched the limits of my knowledge, and while I grasp the concepts, I would very much like to achieve a deeper understanding of the mathematical principals and implementation.\n",
    "* [**Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952) was implemented in my DQN agent, but never fully tested. I believe that for complex tasks like this _Reacher_ environment, or perhaps moreso to the optional _Crawler_ environment, utilizing PER could provide measurable speedup in learning rate. \n",
    "* As explored above in the hyperparameter section, the relationship between `VMIN/VMAX` and the environment rewards merits further study and understanding.\n",
    "* The relationship between action complexity and `atoms` also merits further understanding.\n",
    "* I implemented a D4PG agent as opposed to the base DDPG algorithm because it was newer, presented more challenges, and had less (to none) GitHub examples available, especially in PyTorch. It was well worth the effort required to read, understand, and implement the algorithm. However, it would be good to compare performance with DDPG itself! While D4PG seems to achieve superior results to the instructor provided benchmarks, and learns very quickly and stably in this environment, the extent to which it is or is not superior to DDPG is unclear without a direct comparison to trial.\n",
    "* **PPO/TRPO algorithms** would be good to implement as further comparisons and to add to my tool chest. While I understand Policy Based methods, there is no substitute for _doing_, and to round out my knowledge of the current state-of-the-art, having hands-on experience with these methods would be beneficial.\n",
    "* I believe D4PG has a wide variety of applications to other tasks, especially difficult tasks for which brute-force policy methods might fail. I look forward to running this agent in as many environments as time permits.\n",
    "* **Parameter Noise** is a process by which noise is added to the network weights instead of as a constant applied to the network output. OpenAI has pioneered this process with their paper [_Parameter Space Noise for Exploration_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01905). While this agent quickly converges to an optimal policy in the current implementation, it would be worthwhile to explore parameter noise, as it may be more relevant to more complex tasks such as locomotion."
